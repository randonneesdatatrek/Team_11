    "# **Introduction:**\n",
    "In this project, we have a small dataset ( [from kaggle](https://kaggle.com)) of 1000 observations collected from students performances in three exams and their 5 features, some of these features are inherited, that means the student have no power to change any of them like gender ethnicity and parental level of eduction and other acquired feature like kind of lunch and test preparation.  \n",
    "In our analysis we try to find  corelation between the features level and the performance, and which features are the more importante, so may helps students improve their perfomance and /or take care of weak performance students.\n",
    "Although the dataset is quite clean, i did make some data clean up just for learning and practice purpose. \n",
    "In the analysis section i checked out the dataset balancing, data discription (statistical metrics), claculation of some sub dataset means and columns filtrering.   \n",
    "For the viusualisation i used pie chart to show the categorical features (gender and race/ethnicity) and bar plot for mean and  scores performances, Box plot for all features and all scores.\n",
    "In test module i used mannwhitneyu and scipy.stats libraries and run test upon some features that I have some doubt about them to confirm what we figure out from graphs.\n",
    "Finally i used Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine  libraries to perfom somme predictions and to classify features importance.\n",
    "# *Note:*\n",
    "In order to use the main module from jupyter lab or google colab you should run all other cells before runing this main module.\n",
