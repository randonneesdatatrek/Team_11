# studentsBAP
*
* studentsBAP or "Students Background Analysis Performance", is my first data-analysis project. As a particpant in project luanched by Ran.donn√©es 2021 Data.trek.

## Project descrition:
 * Anylysing students perfomance in three diferents exams, against their background as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education and lunch and test preparation .
 * Find any correlations between performance and any of categorical variables and find out the most significant ones.
 * Clasification of the of features regarding the best performance. 
 * Predicting performance from a given categorical variables.
 * Evalutaing algorithm perfomance.
### *Main module:*
* This is the command line interface for end users, it gives an inetractive acces for differents modules of project. In this module I also do data clean up, we have to verifiy if there is any missing data and try out what better way.If there is a wrong data, say a non-numeric value inside a numeric column or missing values etc.. we have to replace them or may be delete the row containg it.
The following modules they will be imported by main module:

* *Module analysis:*, it performs descriptive statistics and make a report or comments .

* *Module graph:* show some usefull plot to understand features and categorical data.

* *Module test:* perfoms two different test, one-way and two-ways test.

* *Module machine learning:* to peform clasification and prediction.

* Materials: I have been using pandas for data precessing, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation, RandomForestClassifier for prediction and features calssification,  OrdinalEncoder to encode non numeric features.
